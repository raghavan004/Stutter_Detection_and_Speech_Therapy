# Solution Overview:
This ReactJS application leverages deep learning and NLP models to assist individuals with stuttering. It comprises three core modules:

## Stutter Detection & Classification:

Utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model (Wave2vec) to analyze audio input and classify different types of stutters (e.g., repetitions, prolongations, and blocks).

Provides real-time feedback to users with visual and audio indicators.

## Stutter Correction/Aide with BERT:

Incorporates a fine-tuned BERT model to suggest corrections and alternatives for detected stuttered speech.

Generates context-aware suggestions to guide users in improving speech fluency.

## Speech Therapy Component:

Interactive speech therapy exercises with configuration options to modify pacing according to the user's stutter profile.

# Running the App:
cd Frontend/FLOWSpeak && npm install && npm run dev

# Running the Backend:

## Real World Applications
### Upon implementing Text To Speech, you may implement the stutter correction component to be used in online meetings for people with stuttering (block) problems , to automatically aide them
### Practice speaking using speech therapy component before any important speeches for people with stuttering (repetition) problems
### We would also love to take inputs from people with ideas on how to help people who have stuttering issues through the contact form.
